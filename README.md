This Python-based tool allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt .txt files and messages using a custom hybrid encryption mechanism. It leverages technologies such as SHA-256, Base64, and Fernet, while applying an obfuscation layer that hides the type of cryptography used ‚Äî making it readable only by this software.

üîê Features:

Encrypt and decrypt files or messages

Obfuscates the cryptographic method to avoid reverse engineering

User-defined seed/encryption key/passphrase

Minimal dependencies, easy to use, and secure by design

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Only this software can decrypt the content, as the structure and method are uniquely implemented and obfuscated.

üì¶ Requirements

To run MysticLock, you'll need the following Python packages:

cryptography

reedsolo
